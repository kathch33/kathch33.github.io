## Field notes

- **title:** Use double quotes. Title case.
- **date:** Always include timezone offset. Use `+0100` (CET) for winter dates and `+0200` (CEST) for summer dates. See `blog-config.md` for the exact cutover rule. Use the publication time from your config.
- **description:** One sentence. Shows in link previews and search results.
- **categories:** Title case, no quotes. Common values: `Technology`, `AI`, `Software Development`, `Open Source`.
- **tags:** Lowercase, hyphenated, in double quotes. Keep to 3-6 tags.
- **type:** Always `post` for blog posts.
- **weight:** Use the value from `blog-config.md` if your theme uses it for ordering.
- **showTableOfContents:** Set to `true` for posts with 3+ sections.
- **ai:** Set to `true` if the post was generated with AI assistance. Controls the authorship banner shown on the post and the robot/human emoji in the posts list. Defaults to `false` (human-written).
- **image:** Optional. Path relative to `static/`. Used as cover image.
- **related:** Optional. Array of internal post paths for the related posts section. These render as visual cards (with cover images) at the bottom of the post, powered by the `related-posts.html` partial. Use the format `/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug` (no `.md`, no trailing slash). Do NOT put related posts as markdown links in the content body.
